# Drupal 8

Time to get started with Drupal 8. The development to release a stable Drupal 8 version took about four years. The development phased started March 10, 2011. The first beta was released **October 1, 2014**, right after the new base theme, Classy, got commit to core. A whole new theming layer should make the life of Drupal "themers" easier. On **October 7, 2015**, the first release candidate was announced. Finally, on November 19, 2015, the first stable version was released.
